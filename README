JTV Explorer is a sample app for the Justin.tv REST API written in Ruby on Rails.

Run the jtvexplorer rails app and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the complete list of actions supported by jtvexplorer.

In order to run this you will have to change a few variables in config/environment.rb. Please set the following:

  API_PATH = "/api"
  API_HOST = "api.justin.tv"
  API_PORT = 80
  
Also, you will need to install sqlite3 and the ruby gem.  For example, on Mac OS X:

  sudo port install sqlite3
  sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
